According to various documentation, the cookie domain has to contain **at least** 2 dots for a browser to accept this
as a wildcard cookie (e.g. `.google.com`) and use this for all sub-domains. So `.foo.bar.com` should work - **should**.
Opera doesn't like it and only accepts it domain-wide if there are **exactly** 2 dots in the domain name. In this case
`.bar.com`. If you use `.foo.bar.com` the string is ignored and the cookie only gets set for the current domain.
